\title{
Plot Classifications Corresponding to Successive Combined Solutions
}
\description{
Plot classifications corresponding to successive combined solutions. 
}
\usage{
combiPlot(data, z, combiM, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
  The data.
}
  \item{z}{
  A matrix whose [i,k]th entry is the probability that observation i in the data belongs to the kth class, for the initial solution (ie before any combining). Typically, the one returned by \code{Mclust}/BIC.
}
  \item{combiM}{
  A "combining matrix" (as provided by \code{\link{clustCombi}}), ie a matrix whose kth row contains only zeros, but in columns corresponding to the labels of the classes in the initial solution to be merged together to get the combined solution.
}
  \item{\dots}{
  Other arguments to be passed to the \code{\link{Mclust}} plot functions.
}
}
\value{
Plot the classifications obtained by MAP from the matrix \code{t(combiM \%*\% t(z))}, which is the matrix whose [i,k]th entry is the probability that observation i in the data belongs to the kth class, according to the combined solution obtained by merging (according to \code{combiM}) the initial solution described by \code{z}.
