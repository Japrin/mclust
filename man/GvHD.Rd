\description{
GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) data of Brinkman et al. (2007). Two samples of this flow cytometry data, one from a patient with the GvHD, and the other from a control patient. The GvHD positive and control samples consist of 9083 and 6809 observations, respectively. Both samples include four biomarker variables, namely, CD4, CD8b, CD3, and CD8. The objective of the analysis is to identify CD3+ CD4+ CD8b+ cell sub-populations present in the GvHD positive sample.

A treatment of this data by combining mixtures is proposed in Baudry et al. (2010).
